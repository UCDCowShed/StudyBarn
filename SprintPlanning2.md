## Summary of Project
Our app “StudyBarn” helps students easily locate and explore study environments on campus, providing information on 
cafes, libraries, and collaborative spaces based on user preferences and ratings. Students can enjoy features like 
noise level and crowdedness of the study environment, ensuring an optimal study experience.
