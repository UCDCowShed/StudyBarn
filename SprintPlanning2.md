## Summary of Project
Our app “StudyBarn” helps students easily locate and explore study environments on campus, providing information on 
cafes, libraries, and collaborative spaces based on user preferences and ratings. Students can enjoy features like 
noise level and crowdedness of the study environment, ensuring an optimal study experience.

## Summary of Work
We designed the structure view-flow, login features with google authentication, added more views.

**Ann Yip**: Worked on the  `locationBoxView` with the `detailsView` where the users can navigate to details of 
location.

**Jinho Yon**: Updated `settingsView` where the users can edit their profiles.
