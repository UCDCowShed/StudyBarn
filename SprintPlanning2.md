## Summary of Project
Our app “StudyBarn” helps students easily locate and explore study environments on campus, providing information on 
cafes, libraries, and collaborative spaces based on user preferences and ratings. Students can enjoy features like 
noise level and crowdedness of the study environment, ensuring an optimal study experience.

## Summary of Work
We designed the structure of the file system as well as the data handling models.

**Ann Yip**: Worked on the  `selectView` with the `tabbar` where the users can navigate to different views.

**Yeongjin Lee**: Worked on the `loginView` and researched on the firebase authentication to allow users to login 
with their google accounts.

**Jinho Yon**: Worked on the `settingsView` where the users can edit their profiles.
